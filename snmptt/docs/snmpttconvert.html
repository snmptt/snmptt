<h1>SNMPTTCONVERT</h1>
<p>Some vendors provide a file that can be imported into HP
Openview using a HP Openview utiltity. SNMPTTCONVERT is a simple
Perl script which will convert one of these files into the format
used by SNMPTT. The file can contain multiple traps.</p>
<p>For example, if the file ciscotrap.txt contained:</p>
<pre><code> rpsFailed {.1.3.6.1.4.1.437.1.1.3} 6 5 - "Status Events" 1  
 Trap received from enterprise $E with $# arguments: sysName=$1  
 SDESC  
 "A redundant power source is connected to the switch but a failure exists in  
 the power system."  
 EDESC
</code></pre>
<p>Executing snmpttconvert ciscotrap.txt would output:</p>
<pre><code> #  
 #  
 #  
 EVENT rpsFailed .1.3.6.1.4.1.437.1.1.3.0.5 "Status Events" Normal  
 FORMAT Trap received from enterprise $E with $# arguments: sysName=$1  
 #EXEC qpage -f TRAP notifygroup1 "Trap received from enterprise $E with $# arguments: sysName=$1"  
 SDESC  
 "A redundant power source is connected to the switch but a failure exists in  
 the power system."  
 EDESC
</code></pre>
<p>Note: The #EXEC line is added by default. This can be changed by
editing the SNMPTTCONVERT script.</p>

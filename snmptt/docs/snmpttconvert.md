#SNMPTTCONVERT

Some vendors provide a file that can be imported into HP Openview using a HP Openview utiltity.  SNMPTTCONVERT is a simple Perl script which will convert one of these files into the format used by SNMPTT.  The file can contain multiple traps.

For example, if the file ciscotrap.txt contained:

     rpsFailed {.1.3.6.1.4.1.437.1.1.3} 6 5 - "Status Events" 1  
     Trap received from enterprise $E with $# arguments: sysName=$1  
     SDESC  
     "A redundant power source is connected to the switch but a failure exists in  
     the power system."  
     EDESC

Executing snmpttconvert ciscotrap.txt would output:

     #  
     #  
     #  
     EVENT rpsFailed .1.3.6.1.4.1.437.1.1.3.0.5 "Status Events" Normal  
     FORMAT Trap received from enterprise $E with $# arguments: sysName=$1  
     #EXEC qpage -f TRAP notifygroup1 "Trap received from enterprise $E with $# arguments: sysName=$1"  
     SDESC  
     "A redundant power source is connected to the switch but a failure exists in  
     the power system."  
     EDESC
  
Note:  The #EXEC line is added by default.  This can be changed by editing the SNMPTTCONVERT script.
